Compared the performance for sorting 224,714 words (source of input file: https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu),
following is conclusion:
i)   Quick3Way is competitive with std::sort when input is random (gets beaten by around 10%)
ii)  For sorted input, Quick3Way is too expensive
iii) Quick3WayString beats std::sort with both random/sorted inputs!
iv)  Quick3WayString sorts's performance is similar for both sorted/random inputs

Following is a brief overview of performance numbers (not from micro-benchmarking but from google tests):
1) Input type: Sorted, sample size: 224,714
   std::sort      : 34 ms
   Quick3Way      : 948 ms
   Quick3WayString: 32 ms

2) Input type: Random, sample size: 224,714
   std::sort      : 56 ms
   Quick3Way      : 67 ms
   Quick3WayString: 33 ms
